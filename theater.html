        MASHA      : Here you are, sitting here, doing nothing. <br>

        CHEBUTIKIN : What then?                                 <br>

        MASHA      : [Sits] Nothing.... [Pause] Did you love my mother? <br>

        CHEBUTIKIN : Very much.                                 <br>

        MASHA      : And did she love you?                      <br>

        CHEBUTIKIN : [After a pause] I don't remember that.     <br>
        
        MASHA      : Is my man here? When our cook Martha used to ask about her gendarme, she used to say my man. Is he here?
